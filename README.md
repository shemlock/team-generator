## Description

Team generator is a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates a HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Information can be added for one manager, and as many engineers and interns as you like. 

The motivation for this project was to allow users to consolidate team information into a easily accessible webpage that displays their team's information, so that it is quick and easy to access details such as their email address or GitHub profile.

This project solves the problem of having team member information scattered everywhere. It streamlines the process of generating the html file and team webpage. Users can then easily find out basic information about their team members, in an accessible and intuitive way. 

  Building this project helped me learn about
  * Node.js
  * Inquirer
  * Jest
  * Unit Testing
  * Object Oriented Programming
